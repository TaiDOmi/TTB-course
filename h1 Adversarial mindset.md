# h1 Adversarial Mindset (homework)

## x) Summaries
**Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains (Hutchins et al 2011)**
- New class threats "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT): Attackers are better resourced, organized and more skilled than before.
  - Long term hacking campaigns with advanced tools and methods that can break through the typical computer network security means.
- 'Kill chain' is a defence model to protect from attackers by understanding and breaking an attack down to phases.
    - The idea is to recognize patterns in attacks and improve defenses against attacks and improve the effectiveness of security investments.
    - Cut one chain (phase) to mitigate the attack
    - The method is called "Intelligence-driven computer network defense (CND)"
      
- Conventional security methods fail because of assumptions that action should be taken only after security breach has happened and that the problem that caused the breach is a fixable flaw.

**ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix**
Explain "tactic", "technique" and "procedure" in context of ATT&CK, and give an example of each. 
Definitions and examples: 
Tactic
Technique
Procedure

## a) How would you compare Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix? Who do you think could benefit from these models?

## b) Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability and (business) impact. (You can find writeups about security incidents from Darknet Diaries and Krebs)

## c) Install Debian on Virtualbox. Report your work, including the environment (including host OS, the real physical computer used), the steps you took and their results.
