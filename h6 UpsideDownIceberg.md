- A simulated attack by penetration tester
- He left a PhishStick (USB stick) to CEOs table
  - Demonstrate different payload
  - USB Dropper attack
  - Keylogger payload in this USB stick
  - When plugged in to Windows a Phishstick it uses injected kestrokes to open Run in Wondows and then fetches the payload from the internet in PowerShell
    - Difficult to notice as attack is shown only a short time on the screen
  - Then records all keystrokes by user (credentials)
  - keystrokes are stored in TEMP file and then send to hacker
  - logs are removed after they have been sent by HTTP POST
  - Consequences: SEvere losses or leagal issues for the company
