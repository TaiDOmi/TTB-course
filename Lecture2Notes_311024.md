Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and their practical applications (Lauri Virkam√§ki)

 blockchain is a public ledger with an agreed-upon algorithm to handle transactions and that works in a decentralized peer to peer fashion
 transactions are digitally signed by the sender and sent to nodes to be processed.
 Transaction are aggregated into blocks by the nodes.
 blocks are then verified and validated based on algorithms of the specific blockchain

 Public key cryptograpy consists of public and private key
 message is encrypted with the public key, it can only be decryptedd with the public key, which tells the decrypting party that the message was sent by the person holding the private ky.

 - bitcoin is the original chain and is slow, does not scale well
 -   new blocks every 10 minutes
-   Ethereum is faster
  -     new blocks every 12 seconds
-   Monero is built with privacy in mind, impossible to track tokens
  - new blocks every 2 seconds

Consensus mechanisms
- Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Space
- Proof of Work used in Bitcoin and many other chains
- Proof of Work (mining), Proof of Stake (staking), Proof of Space (mining)
- 
Cryptocurrencies are tokens within a blockchain.
Cryptocurrencies are generated as rewards from block generation (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
Sending tokens to an invalid address causes the tokens to be lost forever

Stablecoins are intended to be pegged to real (fiat) currency eg. 1 USDC = 1 USD 

Risks
- 51 % attack/blockchain takeover
  - very unlikey on larger chains due to the existing computing power and staking amounts
- Scams / rugpulls
- Regulatory environment
- Collapse and hacking of crypto exchanges
- Private keys (backing up and handling private keys)
Is there a risk that bitcoin would lose all it's value?
